# SOLUTION FOUND - Next.js on Azure App Service

## Root Cause Identified âœ…

The core issue was related to how Next.js builds are handled when deploying to Azure App Service:

1. **Primary Error**: `Could not find a production build in the './.next' directory`
2. **Root Cause**: Next.js application wasn't being built before the server tried to start

## Two Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Robust Build-Time Detection (Primary)

We've implemented a comprehensive solution that ensures the Next.js application is properly built:

1. **Enhanced server.js**:
   - Checks for the existence of the `.next` directory at startup
   - Automatically runs `next build` if the directory is missing
   - Handles standalone mode correctly (copying static assets)
   - Includes multiple fallback mechanisms for starting the server

2. **Custom startup.sh script**:
   - Provides an alternative startup method
   - Ensures proper execution in container environments
   - Handles static assets for standalone output mode

### Solution 2: Pre-Build in CI/CD (Preferred for Production)

For production deployments, we recommend using GitHub Actions to:

1. **Pre-build the application** during the CI/CD process
2. **Deploy the built application** including the `.next` directory
3. **Start with `node server.js`** in the Azure environment

## Key Files Updated

1. **server.js**:
   ```javascript
   // Check if .next exists, build if missing
   if (!fs.existsSync('.next')) {
     console.log('Building Next.js application...');
     execSync('npx next build', { stdio: 'inherit' });
   }
   
   // Handle standalone mode if detected
   if (fs.existsSync('.next/standalone')) {
     // Copy static assets and start standalone server
   } else {
     // Start regular Next.js server
   }
   ```

2. **startup.sh**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Show .next directory contents
   echo ".next directory contents:"
   ls -la .next
   
   # Check for standalone mode
   if [ -d ".next/standalone" ]; then
     echo "Detected standalone output mode. Starting standalone server..."
     # Copy static files and start server
   else
     # Use regular Next.js server
     npx next start -p $PORT || node server.js
   fi
   ```

3. **package.json**:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "next dev",
     "build": "next build",
     "start": "node server.js"
   },
   "engines": {
     "node": "22.x",
     "npm": "10.x"
   }
   ```

## Azure Configuration

### Recommended App Settings:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION=22.17.0
SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true
```

### Startup Command Options:

```
node server.js
```

or for more robust startup:

```
bash startup.sh
```

## Documentation Added

1. **AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md**: Complete deployment guide for Azure App Service
2. **CONTAINER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Detailed troubleshooting guide for container issues

## Why This Works

Our solution addresses the core issue by:

1. **Ensuring build happens**: Either during deployment or at runtime
2. **Multiple fallback mechanisms**: If one approach fails, others are tried
3. **Proper error handling**: Clear error messages and diagnostic logging
4. **Standalone mode support**: Correct handling of Next.js standalone output

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy with GitHub Actions**: Use CI/CD for the best production experience
2. **Monitor logs**: Check for any remaining issues
3. **Configure environment variables**: Set up all required environment variables

This solution provides a robust approach to deploying Next.js applications to Azure App Service, solving the common "missing .next directory" issue.
